Getting Started with Nucleus\nThis guide walks you through the complete Nucleus workflow: from preparing base cytosol to analyzing results and sharing them with the community. By the end, you'll understand how the pieces fit together and be ready to contribute your own work.\nPrerequisites\n\nBasic lab skills for molecular biology\nFamiliarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks (helpful but not required)\nA willingness to share your work openly\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nHow to prepare base cytosol using the kit\nHow to analyze your data on Nucleus Hub\nHow to document your work as a Developer Note\nHow to engage with the Nucleus community\n\nStep 1: Prepare Base Cytosol\nThe Nucleus Distribution includes multiple approaches for preparing base cytosol. For this tutorial, we'll use the Base Cytosol Kit, which provides a standardized starting point.\nFollow the protocol: Making Base Cytosol from Kit\nOnce complete, you should have:\n\nPrepared cytosol samples\nFluorescence measurements or other assay data\nRaw data files ready for analysis\n\nStep 2: Analyze Your Data\nNucleus Hub is a JupyterHub-based platform that provides pre-configured analysis environments. No installation required—just log in and start working.\nWhy use Nucleus Hub?\n\nPre-installed tools and libraries\nReproducible computational environments\nAnalysis templates for common workflows\nDirect integration with the Nucleus Distribution\n\nGet started: Introduction to Nucleus Hub\nAfter completing the tutorial, you'll have:\n\nA Nucleus Hub account\nAnalysis notebooks with your results\nPlots and summary statistics\n\nStep 3: Share Your Results\nDeveloper Notes (DevNotes) are how we document and share work in Nucleus. They're built on Jupyter notebooks and MyST Markdown, so if you've already done your analysis in a notebook, you're halfway done.\nWhat makes a good DevNote?\n\nClear documentation of methods\nReproducible analysis code\nDiscussion of results and limitations\nLinks to relevant protocols and modules\n\nWrite your first DevNote: Developer Note Guide\nYour DevNote contributes to the community in two ways:\n\nIt documents real-world performance of Nucleus modules\nIt adds to our growing dataset of cell-free expression experiments\n\nStep 4: Join the Discussion\nWhen your DevNote is published, a forum thread opens automatically for discussion. Community members may ask questions, suggest improvements, or build on your work.\nLearn more: Forum Guidelines\nNext Steps\nYou've now completed the core Nucleus workflow. You know how to prepare reagents, analyze data, and share results. To become a more active contributor:\nBuild New Modules\nUse existing validated components to create new functionality. Document your work thoroughly and test across conditions.\nImprove Existing Protocols\nFound a way to improve yield or reduce cost? Document your modifications and share the results.\nReview the Contribution Standards\nBefore submitting work to the Distribution, review our standards for documentation, validation, and licensing: Contribution Standards\nQuestions?\n\nCheck the FAQ\nSearch the Forum\nOpen an issue on GitHub\n\nWelcome to Nucleus.
