# Overview

The Nucleus Distribution allows you to implement an open standard for constructing synthetic cells based on Nucleus Cytosol, an open forumulation version of the PURE system. 

The Distribution includes validated protocols, genetic constructs, software tools, datasets, and biological materials that are designed to work, and work together. All components of the Distribution are open source, allowing anyone to use and modify the components. The Documentation serves as a knowledge base for enabling collaborative development of synthetic cells of increasing complexity.

**The Nucleus Development Cycle.** All components of the Nucleus platform work together to support the collaborative development of increasingly reliable and sophisticated synthetic cells contained within the Distribution. The **Documentation** (this site) is a knowledge base that contains protocols and  documentation for implementing validated synthetic cell modules. The **Hub** provides a resource for data sharing, analysis using standard digital tools. Useful results can be shared with the community as **DevNotes**. DevNotes can be viewed on the **Developer Note** website. Periodically, contributions made as Devnotes are integrated into the Distribution as validated protocols for others to use and build upon. All components of the platform can be discussed at the **Forum**, come say hello!

<!-- The Nucleus Distribution is an open source, integrated platform for synthetic cell builders maintained by b.next. It provides validated protocols, genetic constructs, software tools, datasets, and biological materials—everything needed to build synthetic cells using the PURE system. The Distribution is designed for interoperability, enabling researchers to build on shared components and scale their work from concept to production.

The Nucleus Distribution is part of the broader Nucleus Ecosystem, which also includes Nucleus Hub (a collaborative workspace for data sharing and analysis) and Nucleus Developer Notes (a platform for rapidly sharing research contributions that feed back into the Distribution). -->

<!-- The seventh release of the Nucleus Distribution (v0.5.0) is now available. Check the [release notes](../about/release-notes.md) to learn about the latest updates. The Distribution is supported by the Astera Institute, Sloan Foundation, and Caltech. -->

# Structure of the Documentation

## Get started

If you're new to Nucleus, check out [From Zero to DevNote](./start/first-guide.md). That guide will walk you through the documentation.

## Protocols

:::::{card}
:footer: We are migrating protocols from our legacy site as modules are validated in Nucleus Cytosol v0.5

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2

:::{card}
:header: 🧬 **DNA Distribution**
:link: docs/dna-distro.md

Physical materials that are used to implement Processes and Modules.
:::

:::{card}
:header: ⚙️ **Processes**
:link: docs/processes/processes-main.md
Processes are core protocols for implementing Base Cytosol and Cells.
:::

:::{card}
:header: 🧱 **Modules**
:link: docs/modules/modules-main.md
Modules extend the functionality of Base Cytosol and Cells.
:::

:::{card}
:header: 🏗️ **Implementations**
:link: docs/implementations/implementations-main.md
Implementations are useful combinations of Modules and Processes.
