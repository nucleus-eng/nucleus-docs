# Overview

Implementations are combinations of useful Processes and Modules. This section is intended to capture where multiple modules have been operated together or characterized under a variety of operating conditions. 


## Implementations

- [Responder Cell: aTc-detection IVHSL-emission](./responder-atc-ivhsl/main.md)

<!-- - Contents of an implementation
    - Brief description
    - Lab-ready protocol
    - Bill of materials
    - List of what to have at your bench
    - Performance data
        - for cytosols this requirement might be upgraded to include a “discovery plate sweep”
        - for cells this requirement might be upgraded to include an “environment plate sweep” - like a discovery plate but for outer solutions.
    - List of supporting DevNotes
    - List of modules and processes used -->

<!-- Implementations typically progress from cytosol-level to cell-level functionality. Consequently, a specific capacity may initially be deployed as a cytosol-level implementation before being upgraded to cell-level. When this upgrade occurs, the cell-level implementation builds upon the cytosol-level version.
