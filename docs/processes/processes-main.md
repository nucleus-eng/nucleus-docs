# Overview

Processes represent the core protocols. They tell you how to transform physical materials into Base Cytosol and Cell. Modules extend the functionality of Base Cytosol and Cell. 

## Base Cell Processes

The Base Cell is formed by encapsulating Base Cytosol (see below) in a liposome.

## Base Cytosol Processes

Base Cytosol is a molecular system with a defined set of components including T7 RNA Polymerase, ribosomes, and tRNA capable of transcription and translation. Base Cytosol builds on the [PURE system](https://doi.org/10.1038/90802), and is optimized for integration and extension.
