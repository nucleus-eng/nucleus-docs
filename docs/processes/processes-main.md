# Overview

Processes represent the core protocols. They tell you how to transform physical materials into minimal cytosols and cells. Modules extend the functionality of these basic cytosols and cells.

### Modify Base Cytosol

- [Assemble Base Cytosol](./assemble-base-cytosol/main.md)

### Make Base Cytosol

The base cytosol module implements transcription and translation powered by creatine phosphate/creatine kinase energy (CP/CK) system.
