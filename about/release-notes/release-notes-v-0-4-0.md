# General

- Nucleus is now Nucleus Distribution.
- The open science policy has been updated [Open science](https://www.notion.so/Open-science-1a1ae616eb51808ab804cc56fba9f514?pvs=21).
- A dedicated FAQs page has been added [FAQs](https://www.notion.so/FAQs-230ae616eb5180bdbd59fc8d018a7227?pvs=21).
- Developer Notes and [Nucleus Community Contributions](https://www.notion.so/Nucleus-Community-Contributions-0cc4d80c9448403f9f308b983999bd0e?pvs=21) is being sunset on Nucleus Distribution. Developer Notes will now appear on a dedicated site at https://devnotes.bnext.bio/.
- A section for tutorials has been introduced that includes [Nucleus Hub](https://www.notion.so/Nucleus-Hub-22dae616eb51802f9e99f51193a30a15?pvs=21), [Developer Notes](https://www.notion.so/Developer-Notes-22dae616eb5180bc9e76dc87f9af0e0e?pvs=21), and [Making Synthetic Cells for Beginners](https://www.notion.so/Making-Synthetic-Cells-for-Beginners-cbafa6d239714913a3186cd07a9d01aa?pvs=21).
- The Development section is being renamed Software.

# Synthetic Cells

- The “Hello, World” Liposome Protocol has been renamed [PURE Cell](https://www.notion.so/PURE-Cell-412dfbe9ffd941bfab16b69ec866de27?pvs=21) and is now categorized as a Synthetic Cell.
- The protocol “Booting up a simple synthetic cell” has been renamed [Making Synthetic Cells for Beginners](https://www.notion.so/Making-Synthetic-Cells-for-Beginners-cbafa6d239714913a3186cd07a9d01aa?pvs=21) and placed under Guides.

# Content

- The [OnePot PURE workshop module](https://www.notion.so/OnePot-PURE-workshop-module-238ae616eb5180fa8e10f1accf3c7cf3?pvs=21) includes new DNA content encoding for the 36 PURE proteins in the pET28a backbone.

# Cytosol

- [Make OnePot Protein Mix](https://www.notion.so/Make-OnePot-Protein-Mix-234ae616eb5180c0b84cf5046d63a803?pvs=21) is added as an alternative to the existing 36-pot protocol for making PURE protein mix.
- [Make Ribosomes](https://www.notion.so/Make-Ribosomes-1e5ae616eb518007a24be26793ffc152?pvs=21) introduces a protocol for purifying *E. coli* ribosomes from A19 biomass.
- [Make tRNAs](https://www.notion.so/Make-tRNAs-1a0ae616eb51806b9976e46979ed4b94?pvs=21) is updated to recommend purifying from A19 biomass over MRE600.
- The structure of [PURE Protocols](https://www.notion.so/PURE-Protocols-0cd5d3af44aa4d5e85871a75a7c9161b?pvs=21) has been re-arranged for clarity.

# Container

# Tutorials

- [Nucleus Hub](https://www.notion.so/Nucleus-Hub-22dae616eb51802f9e99f51193a30a15?pvs=21) is added to help users get started with [Nucleus Hub](https://bnext.bio/hub).
- [Developer Notes](https://www.notion.so/Developer-Notes-22dae616eb5180bc9e76dc87f9af0e0e?pvs=21) is added to help users get started with [DevNotes](https://devnotes.bnext.bio/). If you’re interested in learning more about DevNotes, read [here](https://devnotes.bnext.bio/contribute).

# Software

- The Cell Development Kit is now available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nucleus-cdk/): `pip install nucleus-cdk`.

# Community

- [OnePot Workshop at Nucleus Labs](https://www.notion.so/OnePot-Workshop-at-Nucleus-Labs-23aae616eb518007ae8bdff2b1d64c10?pvs=21). Eight graduate students and postdocs learned how to make PURE from energy mix, protein mix, tRNAs, and ribosomes that they made themselves in five days at Nucleus Labs in San Francisco.
