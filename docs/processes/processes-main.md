# Overview

Processes convert Modules into something useful. A Process often coincides with the simplest possible Implementation, typyically using the plamGFP Reporter Module. For this reason, we often refer to these as ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) implementations. Alternatively, a process will include a quality control and [unit tests](10.1109/MAHC.1983.10102) A Process will contain the following information:

- Contents of an implementation
    - lab-ready protocol
    - Bill of materials
    - List of what to have at your bench
    - Recommendations for storage and unit testing

## Cytosols

Here are a collection of processes that are useful for making and working with Cytosols
