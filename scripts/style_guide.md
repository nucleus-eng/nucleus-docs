# Style Guide for Synthetic Cell Documentation

## Units & Notation
- Always use SI units (meters, seconds, kilograms)
- Temperature: use Kelvin (K), not Celsius
- Concentrations: use mol/L or mM, not percent
- Format numbers: 1.5 × 10⁻³ (not 0.0015 or 1.5e-3)

## Terminology
- Use "synthetic cell" (not "artificial cell" or "engineered cell")
- Use "membrane" (not "lipid bilayer" when referring to the whole structure)
- Use "protocol" (not "procedure" or "method")

## Formatting
- Section headings: Title Case, use ## (not ###)
- Code blocks: always include language (```python, ```bash)
- Lists: use bullets for unordered, numbers for ordered steps
- Bold for first use of key terms: **synthetic cell**

## Structure
- Every section should have: overview paragraph, then details
- Code examples should always have explanatory text before
- Include figure references like: (Figure 1)

## Common Issues to Flag
- Missing units on numbers
- Inconsistent terminology (pick one and stick with it)
- Headings that don't follow hierarchy
- Code blocks without language specified
