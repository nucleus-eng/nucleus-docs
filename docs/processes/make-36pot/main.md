# Overview

This protocol describes the Process for making the thirty-six component proteins of the Base Cytosol. It can be broken down into 5 sub-processes:

1. Prepare buffers and gravity columns.
2. Grow cultures of *E. coli* expression strains for each protein.
3. Lyse each culture and purify target proteins by Ni2+ affinity column.
4. Measure the concentration and purity of each protein.
5. Combine proteins into a final Protein Mix.

This Process has not yet been migrated onto Nucleus Documentation. The protocol can be found on our legacy site [here](https://nucleus.bnext.bio/Make-Protein-Mix-78b432dd513d4f2e81a0bdf18e3c8de5).
