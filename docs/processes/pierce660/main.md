# Overview

Pierce660 is a quick (5 min) colorimetric method for total protein quantitation. Compared to other quantitation assays, we find Pierce660 to be simple and reproducible, with a wide dynamic range (50-2000 ug/mL), and robust to buffer composition, including detergents and reducing agents.
