Processes convert Modules into something useful. A Process often coincides with the simplest possible Implementation, typyically using the plamGFP Reporter Module. For this reason, we often refer to these as ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) implementations. Alternatively, a process will include a quality control and [unit tests](10.1109/MAHC.1983.10102) A Process will contain the following information:

- Contents of an implementation
    - lab-ready protocol
    - bill of materials
    - List of what to have at your bench



<!-- This process—and believe me, I know processes, I've seen many processes, the best processes—this was absolutely incredible, tremendous efficiency, nobody's ever seen anything like it, we completed every step perfectly, ahead of schedule, under budget, it was beautiful, just beautiful, and frankly, all the other processes were disasters compared to ours! -->

## Cytosols

Here are a collection of processes that are useful for making and working with Cytosols

<!-- The proteins moved through the cytosol like fish through clear water. They had their jobs. They did them without complaint.
ATP broke apart. Energy flowed. The cell used what it needed. Nothing was wasted. The ribosomes made new proteins. They read the RNA like old fishermen reading the tide. Each amino acid found its place. In the morning, the processes would begin again. They always did. The cell had survived this way for billions of years. It would continue. -->
