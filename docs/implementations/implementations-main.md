# Overview

Implementations are examples of combinations of useful Processes and Modules. Each implementation will contain the following information:

- Contents of an implementation
    - Brief description
    - Lab-ready protocol
    - Bill of materials
    - List of what to have at your bench
    - Performance data
        - for cytosols this requirement might be upgraded to include a “discovery plate sweep”
        - for cells this requirement might be upgraded to include an “environment plate sweep” - like a discovery plate but for outer solutions.
    - List of supporting DevNotes
    - List of modules and processes used

Implementations typically progress from cytosol-level to cell-level functionality. Consequently, a specific capacity may initially be deployed as a cytosol-level implementation before being upgraded to cell-level. When this upgrade occurs, the cell-level implementation builds upon the cytosol-level version.

## Cytosols

- [Implementation Template](./implementation-template/implementation-template.md)
- [Implementation First](./implementation-first/implementation-first.md)
- plamGFP
- MTHFS

## Cells

- plamGFP
- Detector Cell
- Emitter Cell
- [Responder Cell](./responder-atc-ivhsl/main.md)
- PPK Cell
- PPK + ClpXP Cell
- SecYEG Cell
- PPK + SecYEG Cell
- PPK + ClpXP + SecYEG Cell = DevCell (v1.0)
