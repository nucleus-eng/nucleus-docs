title: From Zero to DevNote
---

# Overview

The purpose of this page is to guide a newcomer through the complete Nucleus technology stack and workflows from making base cytosol to posting a Developer Note (DevNote) that reports on it's performance. Since this is likely the first Nucleus Guide you have encourntered, it will walk through every step with a significant amount of detail. In general, guides tie together documentation from across the site into useful workflows.

## Making Base Cytosol

There are many different ways to make the base cytosol. This distribution includes documentation for making it yourself from scratch. An open-formulation version can also be obtained from b.next. Since the goal of this guide is provide detailed introduction to the whole Nucleus Workflow, we'll start with the Base Cytosol Kit.

If you follow the steps on that page, you shoud find yourself with some data in hand ready to be analyzed. Rather firing up Excel or opening a Google Sheet, we're going to sign into Nucleus Hub. 

## Analyzing Data with Nucleus Hub

Nucleus Hub is an interactive computing platform built on Jupyter Hub. Like it or not, we have to interact with software to get our work done and share it with others. Nucleus Hub provides a way of accessing software tools that just work. No installs, no compiling, no environmental management. Of course if you want to modify your own environments and build code, that's supported as well. The Nucleus CDK lives on GitHub, but the Hub is preconfigured to get you up and running without any additional work. And there's templates. 

- Getting Started with Nucleus Hub

If you followed the steps on that page, you should not find yourself with a Nucleus Hub account and some nice looking plots. Let's tell the Nucleus Community what you've been up to and write up a DevNote.

## Sharing your results as a Developer Note

Nucleus is open source which means that we're building something together. Developer Notes are the key way to contribute to the Nucleus Distribution and gain legend status in the community. Developer Notes are conveniently built ontop of Jupyter Notebooks and MyST Markdown (a flavor of markdown designed for technical communication). Since you've done your analysis in a Jupyter Notebook, you've already half-written your DevNote and you didn't even know it. 

- Writing your first Developer Note

If you followed the steps on that page, you should have successfully posted a Developer Note. Not only does your data help us understand how good you are preparing base cytosols (and how well our reagents are performing), it helps expand the largest on-going interlab study on the expression of plamGFP. It also introduces you to the Developer Community, in a uniquely Nucleus Way. 

## Engage with the community on the Nucleus Forum

Once a DevNote goes live, a thread is opened on the Forum for others to discuss. People might ask you how to replicate what you did, tell you that you made an incredible mistake, or just say "hi". These "Hello, World!" DevNotes go into a special channel and provide a place for people to introduce themselves.

## Am I a Developer Now?

Well, not quite. To be a proper Nucleus Developer, you should probably have developed something. But don't fret, you're well on your way. You are now in command of a growing collection of validated Modules that you can build ontop of and equipped with the tools to analyze and share them. If you Develop something useful or something on the Nucleus Roadmap you should keep in mind the Nucleus Contribution Standards, they are the things you should keep in mind as you go about your work so that it'll end up as part of the distribution. 

- Nucleus Distribution Standards

Once it's in the Distribution, you can safely call yourself a Developer. 

<!-- Getting Started with Nucleus
This guide walks you through the complete Nucleus workflow: from preparing base cytosol to analyzing results and sharing them with the community. By the end, you'll understand how the pieces fit together and be ready to contribute your own work.
Prerequisites

Basic lab skills for molecular biology
Familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks (helpful but not required)
A willingness to share your work openly

What You'll Learn

How to prepare base cytosol using the kit
How to analyze your data on Nucleus Hub
How to document your work as a Developer Note
How to engage with the Nucleus community

Step 1: Prepare Base Cytosol
The Nucleus Distribution includes multiple approaches for preparing base cytosol. For this tutorial, we'll use the Base Cytosol Kit, which provides a standardized starting point.
Follow the protocol: Making Base Cytosol from Kit
Once complete, you should have:

Prepared cytosol samples
Fluorescence measurements or other assay data
Raw data files ready for analysis

Step 2: Analyze Your Data
Nucleus Hub is a JupyterHub-based platform that provides pre-configured analysis environments. No installation required—just log in and start working.
Why use Nucleus Hub?

Pre-installed tools and libraries
Reproducible computational environments
Analysis templates for common workflows
Direct integration with the Nucleus Distribution

Get started: Introduction to Nucleus Hub
After completing the tutorial, you'll have:

A Nucleus Hub account
Analysis notebooks with your results
Plots and summary statistics

Step 3: Share Your Results
Developer Notes (DevNotes) are how we document and share work in Nucleus. They're built on Jupyter notebooks and MyST Markdown, so if you've already done your analysis in a notebook, you're halfway done.
What makes a good DevNote?

Clear documentation of methods
Reproducible analysis code
Discussion of results and limitations
Links to relevant protocols and modules

Write your first DevNote: Developer Note Guide
Your DevNote contributes to the community in two ways:

It documents real-world performance of Nucleus modules
It adds to our growing dataset of cell-free expression experiments

Step 4: Join the Discussion
When your DevNote is published, a forum thread opens automatically for discussion. Community members may ask questions, suggest improvements, or build on your work.

Next Steps
You've now completed the core Nucleus workflow. You know how to prepare reagents, analyze data, and share results. To become a more active contributor:
Build New Modules
Use existing validated components to create new functionality. Document your work thoroughly and test across conditions.
Improve Existing Protocols
Found a way to improve yield or reduce cost? Document your modifications and share the results.
Review the Contribution Standards
Before submitting work to the Distribution, review our standards for documentation, validation, and licensing: Contribution Standards
