# Style Guide for Synthetic Cell Documentation

## General
- Review the text for grammar, spelling, punctuation.
- Identify any empty links.


<!-- ## Terminology
- Use "synthetic cell" (not "artificial cell" or "engineered cell")
- Use "membrane" (not "lipid bilayer" when referring to the whole structure)
- Use "protocol" (not "procedure" or "method") -->

<!-- ## Formatting
- Section headings: Title Case, use ## (not ###)
- Code blocks: always include language (```python, ```bash)
- Lists: use bullets for unordered, numbers for ordered steps
- Bold for first use of key terms: **synthetic cell** -->

<!-- ## Structure
- Every section should have: overview paragraph, then details
- Code examples should always have explanatory text before
- Include figure references like: (Figure 1) -->

## Flag
- Missing units on numbers
- Inconsistent terminology (pick one and stick with it)
- Headings that don't follow hierarchy
- Nucleus versions should generally have the format v0.0 for example v0.5 is good but v0.5.0 should be falgged for review
