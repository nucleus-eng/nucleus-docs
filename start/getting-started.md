<!-- # Overview

The Nucleus Distribution is an open source package for synthetic cell builders maintained by b.next. The Distribution includes integrated digital tools, biological materials, documentation, and validated protocols for the full process of cell building, including cytosol construction, DNA content engineering, and membrane encapsulation.

# Overview




The Nucleus Distribution is an open source, integrated platform for synthetic cell builders maintained by b.next. It provides validated protocols, genetic constructs, software tools, datasets, and biological materials—everything needed to build synthetic cells using the PURE system. The Distribution is designed for interoperability, enabling researchers to build on shared components and scale their work from concept to production.

The Nucleus Distribution is part of the broader Nucleus Ecosystem, which also includes Nucleus Hub (a collaborative workspace for data sharing and analysis) and Nucleus Developer Notes (a platform for rapidly sharing research contributions that feed back into the Distribution).

The seventh release of the Nucleus Distribution (v0.5.0) is now available. Check the [release notes](../about/release-notes.md) to learn about the latest updates. The Distribution is supported by the Astera Institute, Sloan Foundation, and Caltech.

## Get started

If you're new to Nucleus, checkout [From Zero to DevNote](). That guide will walk you through the documentation.

## Get in touch

Join the [mailing list](link-to-signup) or [contact us](mailto:build@bnext.bio) to request access to materials, get involved with the community, or ask questions.

<!-- ## Navigate the Documentation

This documentation is organized into three categories:

:::{aside}
Maybe include a schematic of somekind showing how the categories and subcategories relate relate?
:::

- Module
- Processes
- Collections

Each of these categories is further broken down into the following types:

- Cytosols
- Cells
- Assemblies
- Ants

## Start with collections and work backwards

We recommend looking through the collection of instances to get started. Each instance will contain the following:

- **Bill of materials** (BOM) with product numbers and link-outs to vendor websites.
- **Lab-ready protocol** that includes materials that you should have at your bench and a step-by-step guide for recreating the instance.
- Quantiative data showing the **expected behavior** of the instance.
- **References**  that include the Modules and Processes used to create the Instance as well as any supporting DevNotes. 

The PURE cell is a favorite example.

## Guides contain a wealth of valuable information

The guides will help you get started.

## Technical Roadmap

We are building these tools to build a common system -->
